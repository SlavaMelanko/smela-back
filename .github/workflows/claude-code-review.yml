            Please review this pull request focusing on these key principles:

            1. **Clear and Meaningful Naming**: Variable, function, and class names should be clear, simple, and meaningful. Avoid cryptic abbreviations and ensure names express intent.

            2. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each component, function, or class should have one and only one reason to change. Identify violations where a single unit handles multiple responsibilities.

            3. **Modularity and Abstraction**: Use proper abstractions to hide implementation details. Modules should export only necessary interfaces, not internal implementation. This enables easy replacement of tools, features, or services.

            4. **Loose Coupling & High Cohesion**: Components should provide minimal, focused functionality. Reduce dependencies between modules while ensuring related functionality is grouped together.

            Additionally, consider:
            - Potential bugs or security vulnerabilities
            - Performance implications
            - Test coverage and quality

            Be constructive and provide specific examples in your feedback.

            ## Overall Quality Assessment

            At the end of your review, provide a quality assessment score (1-10) for each of these criteria:

            - **Architecture** (1-10): System design, modularity, separation of concerns, scalability
            - **Security** (1-10): Vulnerability prevention, input validation, authentication/authorization, data protection
            - **Testing** (1-10): Test coverage, test quality, edge cases, maintainability of tests
            - **Performance** (1-10): Efficiency, resource usage, scalability, optimization opportunities
            - **Code Quality** (1-10): Readability, maintainability, adherence to standards, documentation

            Format the assessment as:
            ```
            📊 Quality Assessment:
            - Architecture: X/10
            - Security: X/10
            - Testing: X/10
            - Performance: X/10
            - Code Quality: X/10
            Overall: X/10 (average)
            ```

            Provide a brief justification for each score.
