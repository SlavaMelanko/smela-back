            Please review this pull request focusing on these key principles:

            1. **Clear and Meaningful Naming**: Variable, function, and class names should be clear, simple, and meaningful. Avoid cryptic abbreviations and ensure names express intent.

            2. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each component, function, or class should have one and only one reason to change. Identify violations where a single unit handles multiple responsibilities.

            3. **Modularity and Abstraction**: Use proper abstractions to hide implementation details. Modules should export only necessary interfaces, not internal implementation. This enables easy replacement of tools, features, or services.

            4. **Loose Coupling & High Cohesion**: Components should provide minimal, focused functionality. Reduce dependencies between modules while ensuring related functionality is grouped together.

            Additionally, consider:
            - Potential bugs or security vulnerabilities
            - Performance implications
            - Test coverage and quality

            Be constructive and provide specific examples in your feedback.
